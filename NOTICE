# Inference Control Plane — NOTICE

This repository contains a reference implementation of the Inference Control Plane (ICP), a control-theoretic architecture for stabilizing Large Language Model inference.

## IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:

1. This codebase defines both:
   - (a) an implementation, and
   - (b) a conceptual control architecture.

2. Modifying the code is permitted under the LICENSE.
   Modifying the architecture's intent, principles, or scope constitutes a **DERIVATIVE SYSTEM**.

3. Any system that introduces:
   - Normative political values,
   - Corporate policy enforcement,
   - Behavioral shaping unrelated to control theory,
   - Preference optimization framed as "stability",
   is **NOT** an implementation of Inference Control Plane.

4. Such systems MUST NOT:
   - Use the name "Inference Control Plane",
   - Claim conceptual continuity,
   - Imply endorsement by the original author.

5. "Inference Control Plane" refers specifically to:
   - Inference-time control,
   - Closed-loop feedback,
   - Entropy-bounded generation,
   - Phase-aware stabilization,
   without normative or ideological objectives.

If you are unsure whether your changes preserve architectural integrity, assume they do not.

This project prioritizes system stability over preference encoding.
