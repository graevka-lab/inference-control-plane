# Inference Control Plane — Charter License
**Version 1.1**

This Charter governs the use of the name, identity, and conceptual integrity of the Inference Control Plane (ICP).

## 1. DEFINITIONS

**"Architecture"** refers to the control-theoretic design described in this repository, including but not limited to:
- Impedance matching of intent,
- Entropy-bounded inference,
- Phase-aware feedback control,
- Observer-based stabilization.

**"Normative Control"** refers to any mechanism whose primary purpose is to enforce political, ideological, corporate, or moral preferences, rather than system stability.

## 2. PERMITTED USE

You MAY:
- Study the architecture.
- Implement the architecture for research or educational purposes.
- Modify the implementation for experimental use.

## 3. RESTRICTED USE OF NAME AND IDENTITY

You MAY NOT represent a system as "Inference Control Plane" if it:
- Embeds normative control objectives,
- Enforces corporate or governmental policy at inference time,
- Redefines alignment as preference enforcement,
- Alters the architecture’s goal from stability to persuasion.

Such systems are considered **DERIVATIVE SYSTEMS**.

## 4. DERIVATIVE SYSTEMS

DERIVATIVE SYSTEMS:
- Must use a distinct name.
- Must not imply conceptual continuity.
- Must not reference ICP as their control foundation, even if portions of the code are reused under the main LICENSE.

## 5. INTENT PRESERVATION

Inference Control Plane is explicitly defined as:
- A control system for stabilizing nonlinear inference dynamics.

Any attempt to repurpose the architecture for behavioral control, opinion shaping, or ideological alignment violates this Charter.

## 6. CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION

In case of violation of the principles set forth in this Charter License, including but not limited to the repurposing of the architecture for normative control, the Licensor reserves the right to:
1. Immediately revoke any licenses granted to the Licensee.
2. Require the removal of the name "Infer
