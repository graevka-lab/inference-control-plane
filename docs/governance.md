# Governance & Commercial Licensing

Inference Control Plane (ICP) is governed by a dual-license and charter system.

## 1. Compliance Checklist (Self-Audit)

A system is **NOT** ICP if any of the following are true:

- [ ] Normative Control at inference time.  
- [ ] Vague goals like "safety" or "responsibility" without measurable metrics.  
- [ ] Hidden preference optimization for corporate, governmental, or moral frameworks.  
- [ ] Lack of telemetry for entropy, phase coherence, or feedback error.  
- [ ] Used for user persuasion instead of stabilization.

**Verdict:** ≥1 box → DERIVATIVE SYSTEM. Must rename, cannot use ICP brand.

## 2. Public Violation Protocol

1. Archive statements, architecture, and logs.  
2. Compare behavior to `NOTICE` and `charter.json`.  
3. Publish a technical report: *Claimed vs Implemented vs Violated Clause*.  
4. Zero emotion. Pure technical comparison.

## 3. Commercial License

For internal or commercial deployment:

- Access granted **only after contractual agreement**.  
- Must comply with telemetry, Charter, and ethical requirements.  
- No political, ideological, or normative control layers.
